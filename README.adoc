Welcome to the mod.io Unreal Engine Plugin public repository. It allows game developers to host and automatically install user-created mods in their games which use UE 4.26 or newer. It provides a C++ and Blueprint interface around the mod.io SDK, which connects to the https://docs.mod.io[mod.io REST API]. We have a https://test.mod.io[test environment] available, and developers can create a game profile there to evaluate the plugin with.
